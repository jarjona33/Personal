This repo is to capture all of the research I have done for Datalore. 

Jupyter notebooks in the cloud

Once you register a Datalore account, you can get your first notebook up and running in seconds. No setup is required, and the most popular data science libraries such as NumPy, Matplotlib, pandas, TensorFlow, etc., are already preinstalled.

Intelligent Python code editor

With powerful coding assistance, code completion, inspections, refactorings, automatic quick-fixes, useful hints, and API documentation right at your fingertips, you won't need to use an IDE or text editor.

True collaboration

Work on a notebook together with your team in real time. Built-in version control tracks your changes, and when your work is done you can publish your notebook as a static report to share your insights.

Online editor experience

Datalore supports Markdown and LaTeX. All computations are run in the cloud, which improves the time it takes for visualizations and markdown cells to be rendered.

Share whole workspaces

Share whole workspaces and work together with colleagues on multiple notebooks. Notebooks and attached files will be shared among all the workspace members. You can create a shared workspace via the Workspace menu on Dataloreâ€™s home screen.

Publish PyCharm notebooks

Publish PyCharm notebooks to share the results with your colleagues. You can upload them to Datalore from PyCharm IDE via the pre-installed Datalore plugin. Just make sure you are using version 0.1.18 or later.
